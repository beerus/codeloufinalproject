## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document lays out a project plan for the development of “Smart Recruit," a project by Rajual Z. 

The intended readers of this document are mentors and future employers. The plan will include, but is not restricted to, a summary of the system functionality, the scope of the project from the perspective of the “Smart-Recruit” team (me and my mentors), scheduling and delivery estimates, project risks and how those risks will be mitigated, the process by which I will develop the project, and metrics and measurements that will be recorded throughout the project.

## 2.0 Overview
Tired of second guessing talent to recruit? Let the numbers do the talking.

### 2.1 Customers
School and University management teams.

### 2.2 Functionality

    Users should be able to register through their already existing accounts.
    They should be able to add players to their "Dream Team."
    They should be able to add game stats to raise to decrease player rating with the Tendex rating system.
    
### 2.3 Platform

This will be a Web-based application and possible iOS application in the future.

### 2.4 Development Responsibility

I, Rajual Z, would be developing the software with guidance of my mentors and I am responsible for the creation of the Database and all the other related stuffs.

## 3.0 Goals and Scopes

    Users should be able to register through their already existing accounts.
    They should be able to add players to there team from varying schools.
    Each team should have coach to contact.
    Possibly have a player profile image.
    
## 4.0 Deliverables

I’ll deliver the following during the course of development:

    Feature specification
    Product design
    Test plan
    Development document
    Source code

## 5.0 Risk Management 

### 5.1 Risk Identification 

1) There are better sources out there for this and the lack of media and community on the site lowers the exposure of players.

### 5.2 Risk Mitigation

Even though there is a possibility stats will not be found and players unexposed or overhyped based on teams difficulty.
  1) Allow manually to enter player stats per game. 
  2) Create a community through media and people submit photos and videos via social media.
